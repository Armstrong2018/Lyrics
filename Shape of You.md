#Shape of You      Ed
The club isn't the best to find a lover.  
So the pub is where I go.  
Me and my friends sit on the table doing shots.  
Drrinking fast and then we taling slow.  
You cone over and start up a conversation just with me.
And trust me I'll give it a chance now.
Take my hand stop put Van The Man on the jukebox.  
And then we started to dance and now I'm singing like. 
Girl you know I want your love.
You love was handmade for somebody like me.  
Come on now follow my lead.  
I may be crazy don't mind me.  
Say boy let's not  taking too much.  
Grad on my waist and put that body on me.
Come on now follow my lead.
Come Come on now follow my lead.
I'm in love with the shape of you.
We push and we pull like a magnet do.  
Although my heart is falling to.  
I'm in love with your body.  
Last night you were in my room.   
And now my bed sheets smeel like you.   
Every day discovering something brand new.  
I'm in love with your body.

One week in we let the story begin.  
We're going out on our first date.  
You and me are thrifty so go all you can eat.  
Fill up your bag and I fill up your plate.
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and teh sour.
And how your family is doing ok? 
Leave and get in a taxi the kiss at the backset.  
Tell the driver make the radio play and I'm singing like.
